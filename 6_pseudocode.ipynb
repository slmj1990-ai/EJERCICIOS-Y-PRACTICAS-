    "Pseudocode is a way of expressing the logic of an algorithm in plain English or simple statements that resemble programming code. It is not bound by any specific programming language syntax and focuses on the logic and structure of the solution rather than the precise implementation details. Pseudocode helps in planning, designing, and communicating algorithms effectively."

    "\n",
    "Pseudocode follows a structured format that consists of simple statements, control structures, and variables. Here are some basic elements of pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statements: Each line of pseudocode represents a specific action or instruction, written in plain language. For example, \"Print 'Hello, world!'\" or \"Set x to 5.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables: Variables are used to store and manipulate data in pseudocode. They are usually represented by names and can be assigned values or used in expressions. For example, \"Set x to 5\" or \"total = x + y.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input/Output: Pseudocode often includes instructions for reading input from the user or displaying output. For example, \"Read user input\" or \"Display result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control Structures: Pseudocode includes control structures like if-else statements, loops, and function definitions. These control structures help in making decisions and repeating actions. For example, \"If x is greater than 10, then do this\" or \"Repeat until condition is true.\""

    "### Writing Pseudocode\n",
    "When writing pseudocode, focus on expressing the logic of the algorithm in a clear and understandable manner. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n",
    "- Start with a clear problem statement: Understand the problem you are trying to solve and clearly define the inputs, outputs, and expected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break down the problem into smaller steps: Identify the key actions or operations required to solve the problem and outline them step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use meaningful names: Choose descriptive names for variables and actions to improve readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep it simple: Pseudocode should be concise and easy to follow. Avoid unnecessary details and focus on the main steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indentation: Use indentation to represent code blocks within control structures, just like in actual programming languages. This helps visualize the structure and hierarchy of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test your pseudocode: Before translating pseudocode into actual code, mentally walk through the steps to see if they make sense and cover all necessary operations.\n",

    "    Look at the sentence, there is a condition here for stop. Therefore you should use a **WHILE LOOP**. To make sure the code will run, you need to use a variable to store the state of the condition at the beginning. In addition, you will need another variable to store the progress of the runner!"

    "- Implement a validation loop: After prompting the user for input, we can use a loop to keep asking for the value until a valid one is entered. This ensures that the program does not proceed with incorrect inputs. For example, if the user enters \"3\" instead of \"1\" or \"2\", the program will continue to prompt for the correct choice.\n",

    "    - *To remove any leading or trailing spaces from the user's input, you can use the `lstrip()` method. This will remove any spaces from the left side of the input string. Example: input_string = input_string.lstrip(). Also, this method takes an optional argument where you can specify the characters you want to remove from the left side of the string. Example: input_string = input_string.lstrip(\"symbol_to_remove\")*\n",

Example: input_string = input_string.replace(\"old_value\", \"new_value\")*\n",
